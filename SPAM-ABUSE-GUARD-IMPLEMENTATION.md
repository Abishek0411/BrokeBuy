  - Maintains existing functionality while adding pagination
- **Effect**: Large result sets are paginated for better performance

### 7. 📈 Daily Credit Transaction Limit
- **Location**: `app/utils/rate_limiter.py`, `app/routes/wallet.py`
- **Implementation**:
  - Created `RateLimiter.check_daily_credit_limit()` method
  - Integrated into wallet top-up endpoint
  - Limits daily credit transactions to ₹10,000
- **Effect**: Prevents excessive credit transactions per day

### 8. 🛡️ Abuse Flagging System
- **Location**: `app/models/abuse.py`, `app/routes/abuse.py`
- **Implementation**:
  - Complete abuse reporting system
  - Users can report listings, messages, or users
  - Multiple abuse types (spam, inappropriate content, fraud, etc.)
  - Admin interface for reviewing and taking action
  - Evidence URL support for reports
- **Effect**: Community-driven content moderation with admin oversight

### 9. 🔐 Security Challenge System (ReCAPTCHA Alternative)
- **Location**: `app/utils/security_challenge.py`, `app/routes/auth.py`
- **Implementation**:
  - Simple math and word-based challenges
  - Session-based verification system
  - Optional integration with login process
  - Challenge expiration (5 minutes)
- **Effect**: Basic bot protection without external dependencies

### 10. 🧠 Circular Trade Detection
- **Location**: `app/utils/circular_trade_detector.py`, `app/routes/listings.py`
- **Implementation**:
  - Detects direct circular trades (A sells to B, B sells to A)
  - Detects complex circular patterns (A→B→C→A)
  - Detects rapid back-and-forth trading
  - Integrated into purchase process
- **Effect**: Prevents artificial trading patterns and potential abuse

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Input Sanitization
- Regex-based pattern removal
- HTML escaping for security
- Length validation
- Spam keyword detection
- Character pattern validation

### Review System
- Purchase verification through database queries
- One review per purchase enforcement
- Verified review marking
- Full CRUD operations with proper authorization

### Abuse Reporting
- Multi-target reporting (listings, messages, users)
- Admin workflow for review and action
- Evidence URL support
- Status tracking and admin notes

### Circular Trade Detection
- Graph-based analysis of trading patterns
- Time-window based detection
- Multiple pattern types (direct, complex, rapid)
- Statistical analysis of trading behavior

## 🚀 API Endpoints Added

### Reviews
- `POST /reviews/` - Create review
- `GET /reviews/listing/{listing_id}` - Get listing reviews
- `PUT /reviews/{review_id}` - Update review
- `DELETE /reviews/{review_id}` - Delete review
- `GET /reviews/my-reviews` - Get user's reviews

### Abuse Reports
- `POST /abuse/report` - Create abuse report
- `GET /abuse/my-reports` - Get user's reports
- `GET /abuse/admin/pending` - Get pending reports (admin)
- `PUT /abuse/admin/{report_id}` - Update report (admin)
- `POST /abuse/admin/{report_id}/take-action` - Take action (admin)

### Security

- `POST /auth/login` - Login with optional challenge

## 📊 Database Collections

### New Collections
- `reviews` - User reviews for listings
- `abuse_reports` - Abuse reports and admin actions

### Enhanced Collections
- `messages` - Now includes rate limiting data
- `listings` - Now includes sanitized content
- `users` - Now includes input validation
- `wallet_history` - Now includes daily limits

## 🛡️ Security Features

1. **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
2. **Rate Limiting**: Multiple layers of rate limiting for different operations
3. **Spam Detection**: Pattern-based spam detection and filtering
4. **Abuse Prevention**: Community reporting and admin moderation
5. **Trade Integrity**: Circular trade detection and prevention
6. **Bot Protection**: Simple challenge-response system
7. **Purchase Verification**: Reviews only from verified purchasers

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- Pagination reduces database load for large result sets
- Rate limiting prevents abuse and excessive resource usage
- Input sanitization happens at the API level
- Circular trade detection uses efficient graph algorithms
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexing

## 🔄 Integration Points

All features are integrated into existing endpoints:
- Message sending now includes rate limiting and text limits
- Listing creation includes rate limiting, sanitization, and spam detection
- Purchase process includes circular trade detection
- Wallet operations include daily credit limits
- Search results include pagination
- User updates include input validation

## ✅ Testing Recommendations

1. Test rate limiting with multiple rapid requests
2. Test input sanitization with various spam patterns
3. Test review system with purchase verification
4. Test abuse reporting workflow
5. Test circular trade detection with various patterns
6. Test pagination with large datasets
7. Test security challenges with correct/incorrect answers

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

- All features are backward compatible
- No database migrations required (uses existing collections)
- New routes are properly registered in main.py
- All utilities are properly imported and integrated
- Error handling is consistent with existing patterns

The implementation provides comprehensive spam and abuse protection while maintaining system performance and user experience.
